### 👋 Hi, there ! I’m Vishal Singh

#### 🤖 Machine Learning Enthusiast | 🧠 Data Science Explorer | 💡 Automating "What Ifs" 
*(because who has time for manual ifs?)*

#### A Little About Me:

* 📊 I believe every dataset has a story—my job is to help it find its voice (preferably in Python).
* 💻 I’ve been caught feeding my ML models snacks (spoiler: it’s just data).
* 🧩 Debugging code is like solving puzzles—except the puzzles scream when you get it wrong.
  
#### What I Do:
* 🌱 Teach machines to think (or at least fake it convincingly).
* ⚙️ Build algorithms to help computers help us.
* 🤝 Collaborate with like-minded data nerds to create beautiful chaos.

#### Connect with Me:
* 💬 Always up for discussing ML, data, or why gradient descent keeps spiraling into madness.
* ⭐ Let’s make GitHub a little smarter—one commit at a time!

*PS: My models are 90% accurate. The 10%? They're just being creative.*
