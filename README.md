### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Vishal Singh
#### Machine Learning Engineer | Data Science Explorer | Automating "What Ifs" *(because who has time for manual if-else)*

#### A Bit About Me:
* I believe every dataset hides a storyâ€”my mission? *Help it speak, preferably in Python*
* I may or may not have referred to training ML models as "feeding my digital pets" *(Spoiler: they only eat data)*
* When life gives me data, I clean it, model it, and sometimes overfit itâ€”*just for fun*

#### What I Do:
* Teach machines to think or at least pretend convincingly
* Build algorithms that make computers smarter and our lives easier
* Collaborate with bright minds to turn data chaos into actionable insights
* Save time and resources by automating repetitive tasks and optimizing processes

#### My Toolkit:
* Programming Languages: Python (my BFF), SQL
* Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
* Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Docker, Git, Excel

#### Why I Do It:
* Because machines are awesome, but they could be awesomer with a little help

#### Letâ€™s Connect:
* Always open to geek out about ML, data, or why gradient descent keeps spiralling into madness
* Letâ€™s make GitHub smarter, one insightful commit at a time!

*PS: My models are 90% accurate. The other 10%? Call it creative expression*
